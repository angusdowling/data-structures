# Stack

A stack data structure implementation in c++

## Goals

Learn about the following concepts:
* Structs. `Node` has been implemented as a struct instead of a class.
* Conditional return values. Can use std::optional (as implemented in Stack::pop and Stack::peek), pointers, or exception handling.
